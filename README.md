# Dynamic-Minimap-Generation-via-World-LOD-Grid
Using a runtime-generated 2D grid, derived from the extents of the level geometry, this system orthographically projects the environment onto a texture that spans the entire grid. That texture then serves as the basis for rendering accurate map topology (e.g. height data) and is dynamically culled in an HLSL shader based on the minimap's current radius relative to the player's world position. The much smaller minimap then translates its 0-1 UV coordinates to the corresponding region of the full world texture, ensuring correct scale and orientation on the HUD, while also adjusting the position and scale of any sprites placed within the minimap context.
